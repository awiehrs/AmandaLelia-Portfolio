# AmandaLelia-Portfolio
Updated Portfolio Jan 2021

## Description

This portfolio update integrates my up-to-date learned knowledge of jQuery and extended CSS. I wanted to challenge myself by removing the separate pages aspect and creating a single-page portfolio that reacts appropriately through the use of script.
This version integrates more images than my previous portfolio, and a current professional photo in my 'About' section.
